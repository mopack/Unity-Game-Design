# Unity Game Design

I use C# and Unity engine to design 3d games. There are some projects made by myself.

## Projects

* Roll A Ball: You're controling a ball on a table. Catch all the gems to win the game.

* Cowboy Run: You're controling a cowboy running stoppably. Avoid the traps, get on the trucks, and try to get as most gold and run as long as you can.
